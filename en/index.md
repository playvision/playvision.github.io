Games and Playvision. 

Thanks to the developer platform, 
you can create an application which will be available to users directly from the Playvision interface.

We offer a multitude tools for popularizing applications to provide you with the means to successfully monetize your ideas. 
You can use as many of your own servers as you like and interact with the Playvision service through its API, 
which unlocks expansive opportunities for creating all different kinds of games.

Before you start work with API you should choose correct api domain to work with.

1. If you're going to integrate your game with http://playvision.ru, then your domain would be api.playvision.ru (instead of **domain**)
2. If you're going to integrate your game with http://playvis.com, then your domain would be api.playvi.com (instead of **domain**)
